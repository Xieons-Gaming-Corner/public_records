They revealed that zeroing out the HT will still allow it to go into Home - I was able to take one of mine, zero out the HT and put it in home. Then I was able to remove it, and have a totally different HT number, not zero'd out, and not the original tracker. 

> * The opinion of XGC is that this is the safest way to both **distribute** and **receive** ``Shiny Meloetta`` - This way when a player moves from SV to Home, and then back to SV they will have a unique ``HT`` exclusive to them. New HT after Zeroing out, and going SV -> Home -> SV
