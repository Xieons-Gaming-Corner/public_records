# Serverdex Public Records
A repository for the front-facing public Serverdex integration with the app Project Phoenix. 
> * Serverdex Entries are coded by DUID - Discord Unique ID #
> * Serverdex Emojis used in the XGC Premium Apps are held here with the syntax ``sdex_{pokemonName}``
> * * To use an emoji you must use the code given to you by the Discord Developer Portal - in this case Rich's Falinks is ``<a:sdex_falinks:1293228472722002000>`` for Project Phoenix. 

Serverdex entries are ``.txt`` files that are created using the Discord Unique User ID - 
> * For example [Xieon: 745733120510394466](https://github.com/Xieons-Gaming-Corner/public_records/blob/main/serverdex/745733120510394466.txt)
